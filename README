Time Machine Introduction

At some point, almost everyone has wanted to build a time machine. The exercises will take you from working with the
API initially, to solving some more complicated problems and eventually to writing your own custom calendar system.

The following examples have been created TDD, that is the tests are all failing and require fixing to be able to 
travel to the next level. 

Beginning:
Before the time traveler can head off, first she must set the course. This will involve a range of date and time 
setting challenges using the API. The unit tests will help to lead the way 

Intermediate: Cross-Region Timetabling

* A School in the UK and Japan are planning an exchange trip.
* You're given in their local dates, and must represent, their school holidays.
* You need to calculate the possible days on which the exchange trip can fall.
* The children need to stay in the location for a minimum of 5 days.
* You should exclude the duration of the flight from the period.
* The children must fly out/back on a weekday at both ends in order to minimise cost.
